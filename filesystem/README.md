This cookbook exists to generically define and create block device filesystems with the minimum of inputs.

This cookbook supports four main types of block devices:

- normal `device` - drives, SSDs, volumes presented by HBAs etc
- device ID `uuid` - mostly found on drives / known block IDs.
- LVM Volume Groups `vg` - found on systems using LVM.
- file-backed `file` - created dynamically and looped back.

We will try to create filesystems in two ways: through keys found in node data under 'filesystems' or by being called directly with the `filesystem` default provider. See the example recipe.

You can also use your own key for a list of filesystems, see the example recipe for an example of this option.

Tools have been listed in the following attribute key : filesystem_tools. This allows for extending the support to other/new filesystems.

Network file systems, nfs and others, are somewhat supported. This cookbook will attempt to create a mount point, enable the filesystem by adding an `/etc/fstab` entry for the filesystem mount and will attempt to mount the filesystem.  This cookbook does not attempt to modify the internal contents of network filesystems.

## Maintainers

This cookbook is maintained by the Sous Chefs. The Sous Chefs are a community of Chef cookbook maintainers working together to maintain important cookbooks. If youâ€™d like to know more please visit [sous-chefs.org](https://sous-chefs.org/) or come chat with us on the Chef Community Slack in [#sous-chefs](https://chefcommunity.slack.com/messages/C2V7B88SF).

## Requirements

- lvm cookbook when creating logical volumes
- package #{fstype}progs to support your chosen fstype. We provide some defaults, too.

## Resources

- [filesystem_create_all_from_keys](https://github.com/sous-chefs/filesystem/blob/master/documentation/resources/create_all_from_keys.md) - Create a filesystem, add a definition to fstab, mount the filesystem
- [filesystem](https://github.com/sous-chefs/filesystem/blob/master/documentation/resources/filesystem.md) - Create a filesystem, add a definition to fstab, mount the filesystem
- [filesystem_filebacked](https://github.com/sous-chefs/filesystem/blob/master/documentation/resources/filebacked.md) - Create a loopback filesystem

## Main Attributes

### `filesystems`

Hash of filesytems to setup - this is called filesystems because filesystem is already created/managed by ohai (i.e. no s on the end).

### `node[:filesystems]` keys

Each filesytem's key is the FS `label`: This explains each key in a filesystems entry. The label must not exceed 12 characters.

We also let you use your own top-level key if you want - see the default recipe and example recipe.

## Usage

Keyed filesystem creation:
